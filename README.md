# JUG DA Lottery Jenkins Plugin #

This is a small example for a Jenkins plugin. The Java User Group Darmstadt 
(http://jug-da.de) regularly invites to a presentation of an interesting topic
from the wide world of Java and related fields. Usually we draw a small gift
to the registered attendees (a book or conference ticket) given to us by our 
sponsors. Someone has has established the tradition to perform the lottery by
a small application written by one of the organizers. Among others we had an SQL 
script or a Java FX (2.0) application. Sometimes the lottery application is 
build using the technology presented in the previous meeting.

So I have set up this small Jenkins plugin to honour the nice Continuous 
Delivery presentation of Steffen Schluff 
(cf. http://jugda.wordpress.com/bisherige-vortrage/2013-2/continuousdelivery/).
